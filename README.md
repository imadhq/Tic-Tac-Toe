# Tic-Tac-Toe
This game is part of my learning journey with 'The Odin Project' curriculum.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus is on implementing game logic efficiently by organizing code into arrays, objects, and functions.

Key Objectives
- Minimize global code by utilizing factory functions.
- Implement a simple yet functional Tic Tac Toe game.
- Allow players to take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid.
- Detect winning combinations and end the game when a player wins.
- Provide a clean and interactive user interface.

Development Approach
- Modular Code: Employ factory functions and encapsulation to organize code logically.
- Game Logic: Implement game logic to check for winning combinations and handle player turns.
- DOM Manipulation: Utilize JavaScript to dynamically update the game board and interface elements.
- User Interaction: Enable player interaction through mouse clicks or touch events.
