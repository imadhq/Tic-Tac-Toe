# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project, I will attempt to create a web based Tic Tac Toe game as part of 'The Odin Project' curriculum.

The main focus of this project is to showcase my understanding of arrays, objects and functions, using JavaScript.

It will be a simple game of Tic Tac Toe, each player will take it in turns to put and X or O in the 9x9 grid, once a player has 3 X's or 3 O's in a row, the game will end and that player will win.
